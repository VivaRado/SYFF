The management case tests the feasibility of the preferred option, in terms of its deliverability within various tolerances. 


#### Achievability:

We have been working with editing fonts with code for a few years now and much of the code and font plumbing existed from projects like [Variomatic](https://github.com/VivaRado/variomatic) or [VRD TYPL](https://github.com/VivaRado/VRD-Typography-Library), the one piece we needed was to make the otherwise complicated list of instructions inside the recombination script, a little more readable and implement a CSS like parser, for that we chose to harvest CSSUtils code.
