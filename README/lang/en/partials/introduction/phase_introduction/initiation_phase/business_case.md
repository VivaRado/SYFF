####We want to get lots of letters from a few, by running recombining and altering functions whose instructions look like CSS.####

While working with Advent the Variable variant, we noticed the multiplicity of instances that makes variable fonts great, is exactly what bores the human as a function has to be repeated across all of them. We decided to test a few functions that would take a set of initial letters and twist and stretch them to the point of creating the whole capital letter encoding of three languages, and [here is the initial plan for that.](), since the script we call "recombination" was reusing letters after some functions where applied to them or cascading, a floating idea was to also make these instructions more approachable to the designer by making them appear similar to CSS.
