UFO2SVG
===================

A converter of UFO glif files to SVG files and back.
NOT A UFO TO SVG FONT. Only .glif to .svg

During conversion the coordinates remain exactly the same
Don't be alarmed if you see your SVG letters outside of the boundaries in Illustrator or InkScape.
This is intended for minimum influence over the coordinates. The only transform applied is Horizontal Flip.
This is because the coordinates of GLIF and SVG are Inverted.
